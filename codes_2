Problem 1
How many Elementary Schools are in the dataset?
select count(*) from chicago_public_schools where `Elementary, Middle, or High School` ='ES'
Correct answer: 462

  
Problem 2
What is the highest Safety Score?
select MAX(Safety_Score) AS MAX_SAFETY_SCORE from chicago_public_schools;
Correct answer: 99

Which schools have highest Safety Score?

In the previous problem we found out that the highest Safety Score is 99, so we can use that as an input in the where clause:
select Name_of_School, Safety_Score from chicago_public_schools where Safety_Score = 99
or, a better way:
select Name_of_School, Safety_Score from chicago_public_schools where 
  Safety_Score= (select MAX(Safety_Score) from chicago_public_schools)
Correct answer: several schools with with Safety Score of 99.

Problem 4
What are the top 10 schools with the highest “Average Student Attendance”?
select Name_of_School, Average_Student_Attendance from chicago_public_schools order by Average_Student_Attendance desc limit 10; 

Problem 5
Retrieve the list of 5 Schools with the lowest Average Student Attendance sorted in ascending order based on attendance
SELECT Name_of_School, Average_Student_Attendance  
     from chicago_public_schools 
     order by Average_Student_Attendance 
     LIMIT 5;

Problem 6
Now remove the ‘%’ sign from the above result set for Average Student Attendance column
SELECT Name_of_School, REPLACE(Average_Student_Attendance, '%', '') 
     from chicago_public_schools
     order by Average_Student_Attendance 
    LIMIT 5

Problem 7
Which Schools have Average Student Attendance lower than 70%?
SELECT Name_of_School, Average_Student_Attendance from chicago_public_schools
    where CAST(REPLACE(Average_Student_Attendance, '%', '')  AS DOUBLE) < 70
    order by Average_Student_Attendance

Problem 8
Get the total College Enrollment for each Community Area
select Community_Area_Name, sum(College_Enrollment) AS TOTAL_ENROLLMENT 
   from chicago_public_schools 
   group by Community_Area_Name 

Problem 9
Get the 5 Community Areas with the least total College Enrollment sorted in ascending order
select Community_Area_Name, sum(College_Enrollment) AS TOTAL_ENROLLMENT 
   from chicago_public_schools 
   group by Community_Area_Name 
   order by TOTAL_ENROLLMENT asc 
   LIMIT 5

Problem 10
List 5 schools with lowest safety score.
 select  name_of_school, safety_score
FROM chicago_public_schools
ORDER BY safety_score
LIMIT 5

Problem 11
Get the hardship index for the community area which has College Enrollment of 4368
NOTE: For this solution to work the CHICAGO_SOCIOECONOMIC_DATA table 
     
as created in the last lab of Week 3 should already exist
select hardship_index from chicago_socioeconomic_data CD, 
chicago_public_schools CPS where CD.community_area_number = CPS.community_area_number and college_enrollment = 4368

Problem 12
select community_area_number, community_area_name, hardship_index from chicago_socioeconomic_data 
   where community_area_number in 
   ( select community_area_number from chicago_public_schools 
where COLLEGE_ENROLLMENT = (select MAX(COLLEGE_ENROLLMENT) from chicago_public_schools)  ) ;
