 1. Socioeconomic Indicators in Chicago
This dataset contains a selection of six socioeconomic indicators of public health significance and a “hardship index,” for each Chicago community area, for the years 2008 – 2012.
A detailed description of this dataset and the original dataset can be obtained from the Chicago Data Portal at:
          https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Census-Data-Selected-socioeconomic-indicators-in-C/kn9c-c2s2

2. Chicago Public Schools
This dataset shows all school level performance data used to create CPS School Report Cards for the 2011-2012 school year.
A detailed description of this dataset and the original dataset can be obtained from the Chicago Data Portal at:
          https://data.cityofchicago.org/Education/Chicago-Public-Schools-Progress-Report-Cards-2011-/9xs2-f89t

3. Chicago Crime Data
This dataset reflects reported incidents of crime (with the exception of murders where data exists for each victim) that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2001 to present, minus the most recent seven days.
A detailed description of this dataset and the original dataset can be obtained from the Chicago Data Portal at:
          https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2

Problem 1
Find the total number of crimes recorded in the CRIME table.
Each case number is for a particular crime so counting distinct case numbers will answer the question.

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT case_number) AS total_crime FROM chicago_crime_data;
/*Counting rows will give the same result as there are no duplicates*/
SELECT COUNT(*) total_rows FROM chicago_crime_data

Problem 2
Retrieve first 10 rows from the CRIME table.
SELECT* FROM chicago_crime_data LIMIT 10;

Problem 3
How many crimes involve an arrest?
Arrest column is a boolean type either TRUE or FALSE.
SELECT COUNT(*) AS crimes_with_arrest 
FROM chicago_crime_data 
WHERE arrest = 'TRUE';

Problem 4
Which unique types of crimes have been recorded at GAS STATION locations?
Crime type is in PRIMARY_TYPE field and location is in LOCATION DESCRIPTION field.
SELECT DISTINCT PRIMARY_TYPE, LOCATION_DESCRIPTION 
FROM chicago_crime_data 
WHERE LOCATION_DESCRIPTION 
LIKE '%Gas station%';

Problem 5
In the CENUS_DATA table list all Community Areas whose names start with the letter ‘B’.
SELECT community_area_name 
FROM CENSUS_DATA 
WHERE community_area_name 
LIKE 'b%';

Problem 6
Which schools in Community Areas 10 to 15 are healthy school certified?
SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE COLUMN_NAME LIKE '%healthy%'
ORDER BY TABLE_NAME ;

SELECT name_of_school 
FROM CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS 
WHERE Healthy_School_Certified = 'Yes' 
AND Community_Area_Number 
BETWEEN 10 AND 15;

Problem 7
What is the average school Safety Score?
/*Rounded the figure to 2 decimals.*/
SELECT ROUND(AVG(Safety_Score),2)AS avg_sfety_score 
FROM CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS ;

Problem 8
List the top 5 Community Areas by average College Enrollment [number of students]
SELECT  Community_Area_Name, AVG(College_Enrollment) AS AVG_ENROLLMENT 
FROM CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS
GROUP BY Community_Area_Name 
ORDER BY AVG_ENROLLMENT DESC 
LIMIT 5;

Problem 9
Use a sub-query to determine which Community Area has the least value for school Safety Score?
Safety score is in character data type in table, so first I found distinct safety scores.
SELECT DISTINCT safety_score 
FROM chicago_public_schools 
ORDER BY safety_score ; 

Fig. 13
Blanks are also present, so the least value is 1.
SELECT COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME, safety_score 
FROM (SELECT COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME, safety_score
FROM chicago_public_schools WHERE safety_score = 1) school;

Problem 10
[Without using an explicit JOIN operator] Find the Per Capita Income of the Community Area which has a school Safety Score of 1.
SELECT cs.COMMUNITY_AREA_NAME, cs.COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER, PER_CAPITA_INCOME 
FROM census_data cd, chicago_public_schools cs 
WHERE cs.COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER=cd.COMMUNITY_AREA_NUMBER AND safety_score=1;
