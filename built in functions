An aggregate function takes a collection of like values, such as all of the values in a column, as input, and returns a single value or null. 
Examples of aggregate functions include:
sum, minimum, maximum, average, etc.

#SUM
SUM(column_name)
select sum(cost) as sum_of_cost from petrescue

# MIN MAX
select max(quantity) from petrescue
select min(id) from petrescue where animal="Dog"

#AVG()

#scalar and string functions
*Round() Length() Ucase() Lcase()*

# DATE & TIME
DATE: YYYYMMDD
TIME: HHMMSS
TIMESTAMP:YYYYXXDDHHMMSSZZZZZZ
            X=Months
            Z=Milliseconds

Aggregate Functions
Query A1: Enter a function that calculates the total cost of all animal rescues in the PETRESCUE table.
select SUM(COST) from PETRESCUE;

Query A2: Enter a function that displays the total cost of all animal rescues in the PETRESCUE table in a column called SUM_OF_COST.
select SUM(COST) AS SUM_OF_COST from PETRESCUE;

Query A3: Enter a function that displays the maximum quantity of animals rescued.
select MAX(QUANTITY) from PETRESCUE;

Query A4: Enter a function that displays the average cost of animals rescued.
select AVG(COST) from PETRESCUE;

Query A5: Enter a function that displays the average cost of rescuing a dog.
Hint - Bear in my the cost of rescuing one dog on day, is different from another day. So you will have to use and average of averages.
select AVG(COST/QUANTITY) from PETRESCUE where ANIMAL = 'Dog';



Scalar and String Functions
Query B1: Enter a function that displays the rounded cost of each rescue.
select ROUND(COST) from PETRESCUE;

Query B2: Enter a function that displays the length of each animal name.
select LENGTH(ANIMAL) from PETRESCUE;

Query B3: Enter a function that displays the animal name in each rescue in uppercase.
select UCASE(ANIMAL) from PETRESCUE;

Query B4: Enter a function that displays the animal name in each rescue in uppercase without duplications.
select DISTINCT(UCASE(ANIMAL)) from PETRESCUE;

Query B5: Enter a query that displays all the columns from the PETRESCUE table, where the animal(s) rescued are cats. Use cat in lower case in the query.
select * from PETRESCUE where LCASE(ANIMAL) = 'cat';




 Date and Time Functions
Query C1: Enter a function that displays the day of the month when cats have been rescued.
select DAY(RESCUEDATE) from PETRESCUE where ANIMAL = 'Cat';

Query C2: Enter a function that displays the number of rescues on the 5th month.
select SUM(QUANTITY) from PETRESCUE where MONTH(RESCUEDATE)='05';

Query C3: Enter a function that displays the number of rescues on the 14th day of the month.
select SUM(QUANTITY) from PETRESCUE where DAY(RESCUEDATE)='14';

Query C4: Animals rescued should see the vet within three days of arrivals. Enter a function that displays the third day from each rescue.
select DATE_add(RESCUEDATE, INTERVAL 3 DAY) from PETRESCUE;

Query C5: Enter a function that displays the length of time the animals have been rescued; the difference between todayâ€™s date and the rescue date.
select DATEDIFF(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,RESCUEDATE) from PETRESCUE;



The sub-select doesn't just have to go in the WHERE clause. 
It can also go in other parts of the query, such as in the list of columns to be selected. 
Such sub-queries are called column expressions

*select EMP_ID, SALARY, (select AVG(SALARY) from employees ) AS AVG_SALARY from employees.*
Another option is to make the sub-query be part of the FROM clause.

Sub-queries like these are sometimes called derived tables or table expressions. 
Sub-queries like these are sometimes called derived tables or table expressions. 
Because the outer query uses the results of the sub-query as a data source.

How does a typical Nested SELECT statement syntax look?
SELECT column_name [, column_name ]
FROM table1 [, table2 ]
WHERE column_name OPERATOR
   (SELECT column_name [, column_name ]
   FROM table1 [, table2 ]
   WHERE condition);

Exercise:
Execute a failing query (i.e. one which gives an error) to retrieve all employees records whose salary is lower than the average salary.
select * 
from EMPLOYEES 
where salary < AVG(salary);

Execute a working query using a sub-select to retrieve all employees records whose salary is lower than the average salary.
select EMP_ID, F_NAME, L_NAME, SALARY 
from EMPLOYEES
where SALARY < (select AVG(SALARY) 
                from EMPLOYEES);

Execute a failing query (i.e. one which gives an error) to retrieve all employees records with EMP_ID, SALARY and maximum salary as MAX_SALARY in every row.
select EMP_ID, SALARY, MAX(SALARY) AS MAX_SALARY 
from EMPLOYEES;		

Execute a Column Expression that retrieves all employees records with EMP_ID, SALARY and maximum salary as MAX_SALARY in every row.
select EMP_ID, SALARY, ( select MAX(SALARY) from EMPLOYEES ) AS MAX_SALARY 
from EMPLOYEES;

Execute a Table Expression for the EMPLOYEES table that excludes columns with sensitive employee data (i.e. does not include columns: SSN, B_DATE, SEX, ADDRESS, SALARY).
select * from ( select EMP_ID, F_NAME, L_NAME, DEP_ID from EMPLOYEES) AS EMP4ALL;
